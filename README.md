# Online-Trader

This is an example of a landing page for an online wallet. I made it using HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and a few lines of jQuery.
Recently upgraded the stylesheet from normal CSS to SASS. You can view the page on a browser using this link http://bit.ly/2JGixOU

### Further improvements
- Add some life to the page by adding some animations
